However the best possible tagging is: <effect>Hundreds of angry students set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates</effect> because they were <trigger>angry</trigger> at the <cause>Soshanguve campus</cause> earlier on Tuesday. However this changes the original sentence. A more suitable tagging is: Hundreds of students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> because they were <trigger>angry</trigger> on <cause>Tuesday</cause>. However the original sentence does not have 'because'. Let's re-evaluate:  Hundreds of <cause>angry</cause> students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates</effect> on <trigger>Tuesday</trigger>. The original sentence is 'Hundreds of angry students set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus earlier on Tuesday.' A more plausible tagging could be: Hundreds of <cause>angry</cause> students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> <trigger>earlier</trigger> on Tuesday. Here 'angry' is the cause, 'set fire... campus' is the effect and 'earlier' is the trigger.
