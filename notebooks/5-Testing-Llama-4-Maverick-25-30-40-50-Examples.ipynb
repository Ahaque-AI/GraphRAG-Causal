      "2. **Identifying Cause, Trigger, and Effect**: \n",
      "   - **Cause**: The cause is the event or condition that leads to an outcome. In this sentence, \"commuters rushed past\" could be considered a context or a circumstance rather than a direct cause of an effect.\n",
      "   - **Trigger**: The trigger is the word or phrase that indicates causality. The sentence lacks a clear trigger word (like \"because,\" \"due to,\" \"led to\") that typically indicates a causal relationship.\n",
      "   - **Effect**: The effect is the outcome or result. The actions of the activists (waving flags and erecting banners) are the main events, but there's no clear effect or outcome described as a result of another cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causality Tests**: \n",
      "   - The sentence doesn't clearly pass the causality tests because it doesn't explicitly state a cause leading to an effect.\n",
      "   - There's no clear \"why\" or outcome directly resulting from a cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Guidelines**:\n",
      "   - The sentence doesn't contain explicit cause-effect wording.\n",
      "   - There's no clear causal relationship that can be tagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the analysis, the sentence \"As commuters rushed past, activists waved flags in the sticky night air and erected tall blue and white banners urging them to join the struggle for self-determination.\" does not contain an explicit causal relationship with a clear cause, trigger, and effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the output should be:\n",
      "```json\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"tagged\": \"NoTag\",\n",

      "Tagged Sentence: <effect>Hundreds of angry students set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> <trigger>earlier on Tuesday</trigger> <cause>due to their anger</cause>. is not correct tagging. However, a possible correct tagging is: Hundreds of <cause>angry</cause> students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> on <trigger>Tuesday</trigger>. However the best possible tagging is: <effect>Hundreds of angry students set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates</effect> because they were <trigger>angry</trigger> at the <cause>Soshanguve campus</cause> earlier on Tuesday. However this changes the original sentence. A more suitable tagging is: Hundreds of students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> because they were <trigger>angry</trigger> on <cause>Tuesday</cause>. However the original sentence does not have 'because'. Let's re-evaluate:  Hundreds of <cause>angry</cause> students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates</effect> on <trigger>Tuesday</trigger>. The original sentence is 'Hundreds of angry students set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus earlier on Tuesday.' A more plausible tagging could be: Hundreds of <cause>angry</cause> students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> <trigger>earlier</trigger> on Tuesday. Here 'angry' is the cause, 'set fire... campus' is the effect and 'earlier' is the trigger. Thus, <tagged>Hundreds of <cause>angry</cause> students <effect>set fire to tyres and barricaded the gates to the Soshanguve campus</effect> <trigger>earlier</trigger> on Tuesday.</tagged>\n",
