      "\n",
      "First, I need to determine if the input sentence is causal. That means checking if there's a clear cause, trigger, and effect present. If any of these are missing, I should output \"NoTag\" and set the label to 0.\n",

      "Looking at the input sentence: \"As commuters rushed past, activists waved flags in the sticky night air and erected tall blue and white banners urging them to join the struggle for self-determination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll break it down. The sentence describes two main actions: commuters rushing past and activists waving flags and putting up banners. The activists are urging commuters to join a struggle. So, the cause seems to be the activists' actions—waving flags and erecting banners. The effect is that they're urging others to join the struggle. The trigger here might be the word \"urging,\" which indicates the cause leading to the effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the instructions, the trigger is a word or phrase that explicitly indicates causality, like \"because\" or \"due to.\" In this sentence, \"urging\" might be the trigger because it shows the purpose of the activists' actions. So, I think all three elements are present: cause (activists' actions), trigger (\"urging\"), and effect (joining the struggle).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I'll apply the tags. The cause is \"activists waved flags in the sticky night air and erected tall blue and white banners,\" the trigger is \"urging them to,\" and the effect is \"join the struggle for self-determination.\"\n",

      "I should make sure not to alter the original sentence structure. So, I'll wrap each part with the appropriate tags without changing the order or words.\n",
